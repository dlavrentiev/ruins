    <p class="centered-content">Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theatre (<em>Ukr. Донецький академічний обласний драматичний театр</em>) was a theatre in Mariupol and was one of the oldest theaters on the east bank of Dnipro in Ukraine. 
        <br/><br/>
        On 16 March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces bombed the theatre. It was used as an air raid shelter during the siege of Mariupol, sheltering many civilians. The estimations of the number of deaths that occurred due to the bombing have varied, from at least 12 to 600.
        <br/><br/>
        Mariupol city officials stated that the theatre was the largest single air raid shelter in the city, sheltering 500 to 1,200 civilians, and at the time of the attack, women and children were sheltering in it. Satellite images of the theatre taken days before the bombing show the word children (<em>Rus. ДЕТИ</em>) spelled out outside the theatre shown in the animation above. It was meant to identify the building to attacking forces as a civilian air raid shelter containing children, and not a military target. 
        <br/><br/>
        In December 2022, the occupying authorities demolished the remains of the theatre.
