    <p class="centered-content">Polina Raiko (<em>Ukr. Поліна Райко</em>) was a Ukrainian naïve painter who began painting her house and property at the age of 69. Her art, characterized by its simplicity and emotional openness, reflects her challenging family life and personal tragedies, establishing her as a significant figure in Ukrainian naïve art. Raiko’s house-museum is protected by the Law of Ukraine “On the Protection of Cultural Heritage”.
    <br/><br/>Sadly, on June 6, 2023, because of the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Raiko's house was flooded. After the flood, only 30-40% of the frescoes remain. Many of the famous ones were lost when the walls collapsed. Currently, preparations are underway for the conservation or restoration of the surviving works.
